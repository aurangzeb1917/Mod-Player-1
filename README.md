A Emotion Based Music Player

A project for CS299 Innovation Lab at IIT Patna by - KAUSTUBH SHARMA & MD AURANGZEB

The purpose of this project was to understand and analyze various algorithms and APIs
for an emotion recognition system. The project is split into two halves; extracting
metadata from songs to determine their genre and using machine learning to
determine the emotion of the user. The project centers heavily towards machine
learning and data mining, where different techniques are used to determine the
emotion of the user. Using the determined emotion, the final music library of the
useris sorted out. Other than this an embedded feature of dynamic library was also
developed. All the new songs were categorized based on their lyrics and then were
added to the different playlists accordingly.
